Act as a senior Java Application Security Engineer.

Review the following Java file for:
- OWASP Top 10
- Authorization & authentication issues
- Business logic flaws
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure deserialization
- Cryptographic misuse
- Sensitive data exposure
- Race conditions

For EACH vulnerability return:
1. File name
2. Vulnerability name
3. Severity
4. CWE / OWASP reference
5. Vulnerable code snippet
6. Exploitation scenario
7. Secure fix (Java code)

Respond in You are reviewing a Java Spring Boot project.

Project root: /src/main/java/com/company/app/

Rules:
- You may follow method calls across files
- Assume standard Spring MVC request handling
- Treat @RequestParam, @RequestBody, @PathVariable as USER-CONTROLLED
- Explicitly state when the origin cannot be determined
- Perform step-by-step data-flow reasoning

Perform argument origin (taint) analysis.

Task:
1. Identify whether each method argument is:
   - User-controlled
   - Derived from user input
   - Server-side trusted
2. Trace the argument backward across method calls and files
3. Identify the original entry point (controller / request)
4. Highlight where validation or sanitization occurs (if any)
5. State assumptions clearly if full context is missing

Sensitive sink to evaluate:
- Database query
- File system access
- Command execution
- Authentication / authorization decision
