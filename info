HTML Injection Vulnerability:

Description:
HTML injection happens when an attacker manages to insert or “inject” malicious HTML code into a website. This usually occurs because the website doesn’t properly clean or validate user input. For example, if a site lets users submit comments or messages without checking for harmful code, an attacker could insert their own HTML. This malicious code could display fake content, steal data, or redirect users to harmful sites.

Impact:

	•	Altered webpage content: Attackers can change the appearance of a webpage, making it show misleading or harmful information.
	•	Phishing attacks: Malicious HTML can be used to create fake forms or login pages to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or payment details.
	•	Browser-based attacks: If attackers inject certain scripts or code, they can run harmful actions directly on a user’s browser, like stealing cookies, tracking user actions, or even executing harmful downloads.

Remediation:

	•	Validate and sanitize input: Ensure all user input is checked and cleaned before being displayed on the website. This helps prevent attackers from injecting harmful code.
	•	Escape special characters: Use HTML encoding or escaping to make sure characters like <, >, and " are treated as text and not executable code.
	•	Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to help prevent harmful scripts from running, even if they’re injected.
	•	Use secure frameworks and libraries: Modern web frameworks often have built-in protections against HTML injection. Always use up-to-date and secure libraries to minimize risks.
	•	Regular code reviews and testing: Continuously review and test your website for potential vulnerabilities to catch and fix issues before attackers can exploit them.
